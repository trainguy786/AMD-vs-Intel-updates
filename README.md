# My Dotfiles 
Welcome
This repo contains a set of example docker-compose files for the many services I run in my environment.
Dotfiles for my Arch install (Kurumi Theme) based off stephan-raabe's MyLinuxForWork dotfiles are also included.
Thank this person for creating this theme:

Any issues that I encounter will be documented here so we can help each other :)
